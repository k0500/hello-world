I'm Roman. I was born in Ukraine, but then my family moved to Belarus. Since childhood, I love sports, music and photography. He graduated from the Belarusian Academy of Music, but there is no opportunity to develop in the country. For myself in life set a goal to achieve excellent knowledge and profession in the field of IT. I have a young son and someone to grow up for and set an example for.
